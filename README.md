# Factorio-AircraftRealism

### Extension to the [Aircraft mod](https://github.com/Stifling-Bossness/Aircraft) for Factorio

Adds aircraft mechanics to make the planes actually behave like planes

## Features

**Everything can be configured, enabled and disabled from the ingame mod settings**

### Takeoff and landing

Planes need to reach their set takeoff speed to takeoff, otherwise it will collide into other objects

Slow down too much and the plane will land, colliding into any objects in the way

### Realistic turn radius

Widens the turn radius of planes, planes can no longer spin on the spot

### Realistic acceleration + braking force

Slower acceleration and braking to feel more like a plane instead of a race car, requiring actual runways to takeoff and land

### Realistic debris damage

Rocks, tree stumps and other objects will now damage the plane more on takeoff and landing

### Environmental damage

Hitting cliffs and running into water on takeoff and landing will instantly destroy the plane

Jumping out of a flying plane will cause it to crash

### Pollution

Planes emit pollution depending on their fuel type and speed

### Strict runway checking

planes must takeoff from tiles with a vehicle friction modifier less than what is set in the settings, otherwise the plane will take damage on takeoff and landing (disabled by default)

## Plane statistics

Gunship: Medium takeoff, medium maneuverability

Cargo plane: Short takeoff, low maneuverability

Jet: Long takeoff, high maneuverability

Flying fortress: Medium takeoff, high maneuverability
